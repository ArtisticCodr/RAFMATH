# RAFMATH
RAFMATH is a computer program that deals with simple calculations
terms entered by the user. RAFMAT is a intelligent program, therefore
allows users to remember certain values in variables. Variable names are made up of letters only. There is no RAFMAT intelligence
the end can therefore account for some advanced features (SIN, COS, TAN, CTG,
SQRT, POW, LOG,>, <, <= ...). The user interrupts by entering the word "EXIT"
exiting the application. <br><br>
--The program works with python3--
